I'm Hasan Malik, a Pakistan-based developer who sometimes shuts myself off just to perfect the color palette on my websites.  
  
Primarily, I work with the React, Next.js, and Tailwind stack.  
  
Right now, I'm exploring the world of WebGL and web animations, especially Three.js and GLSL. [Some Projects](https://www.youtube.com/@HasanMal1k)

I love to learn and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and collaborate with awesome people in the coding world and IRL. Thanks for checking out my [GitRepo](https://github.com/HasanMal1k)! Feel free to mail me or ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasan-mal1k/).  

If you need guidance on the web dev side of coding, I'm here to share. Let's make this better together 🌟✨
