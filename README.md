## Hello Stranger 🧙‍♂️
I'm Hasan Malik, a Pakistan-based developer who sometimes shuts myself off just to perfect the color palette on my websites.  
Right now, I'm competing on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0132f23066f33637cb).  
Primarily, I work with the React, Next.js, and Tailwind stack.  
Right now, I'm exploring the world of WebGL and web animations, especially Three.js and GLSL.  

I love to learn and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and collaborate with awesome people in the coding world and IRL. Thanks for checking out my [GitRepo](https://github.com/HasanMal1k)! Feel free to mail me or ping me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hasan-mal1k/).  

If you need guidance on the web dev side of coding, I'm here to share. Let's make this better together 🌟✨
